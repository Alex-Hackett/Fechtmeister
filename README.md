# Fechtmeister
Fechtmeister is a super simple ASCII art-based turn based duelling game that I wrote in the aftermath of wasting too much time playing "Kingdom Come Deliverance 2", based on old German fencing manuals â€“ it was originally written as a little C++ refresher project, before I ported it to Python.
